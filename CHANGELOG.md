All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.11.6] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Shadowed/stale installs are now self-evident and self-repairing** — verified empirically that a fresh git install of 0.11.5 always prints the `(build …)` stamp, so a bare version in `-V` proves the shell is resolving a *different, stale* install (e.g. an old `npm link`ed checkout shadowing the global bin). Now: (a) a compiled `dist/` with **no** build stamp counts as stale and triggers the in-place rebuild + re-exec; (b) `--verbose` leads with `envbeam <version+build> · <cli path>`; (c) **every non-zero exit** prints the same identity footer — so the running install is visible in any error output. Diagnose duplicates with `which -a envbeam`.

## [0.11.5] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Stale builds can no longer masquerade as new versions** — root cause of "the fix didn't work": `-V` read `package.json` at runtime, so a `git pull` without a rebuild reported the new version while executing old compiled code (which predated the Docker auto-start entirely). The build now stamps `dist/build-info.json` (version + git sha + timestamp); `-V` prints it (`0.11.5 (build abc1234, …)`), and on a version mismatch the CLI **rebuilds itself and re-runs your command** (source checkouts) or prints the exact reinstall command. Escape hatch: `ENVBEAM_SKIP_REBUILD=1`.
- Empirically verified the Docker 25.0.3 daemon quirk against the real 25.0.3 CLI: dead daemon → exit 0, empty stdout, error on stderr — the digit-check from 0.11.4 handles it correctly.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Docker now actually starts itself (macOS + Windows), no user action** — the daemon check now treats any non-version `docker info` output as "down" (docker 25.x prints the connect error to stdout and exits 0, which fooled the previous check), so envbeam reliably detects a stopped daemon and launches it. macOS tries Docker Desktop → OrbStack → colima; Windows tries the system-wide and per-user Docker Desktop paths; Linux starts the docker service. A reactive backstop also retries `compose up` after force-starting Docker if the daemon error still surfaces. No prompt, no waiting on the user.

### Added
- **`ENVBEAM_TRACE=1` also enables command tracing** — same output as `--verbose` but from process start and independent of flag position, so you can verify a deployed build (`ENVBEAM_TRACE=1 envbeam list`) and debug non-interactively.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **`--verbose` now traces every external command** — with `-v`/`--verbose`, envbeam prints each shell-out (`$ docker info …`, `$ doppler secrets …`, `$ aws s3 cp …`) and its exit code to stderr, so you can see exactly what it's doing and where a step fails. (Global flag: put it before the subcommand, e.g. `envbeam --verbose pull`.)

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Docker daemon detection was a false positive on Docker CLI 25.x** — `docker info --format '{{.ServerVersion}}'` exits **0** with empty output (error on stderr) when the daemon is down on older CLIs, so envbeam thought Docker was up, skipped starting it, and then failed at `compose up`. The check now requires a real server version, not just exit 0 — so `ensureDockerRunning` actually starts Docker, and preflight reports the daemon honestly. Shared `isDockerDaemonUp` is reused by the compose/devcontainer auth-checks.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Updates now actually take effect** — added a `prepare` script so `dist/` (which is gitignored and drives the `envbeam` bin) is rebuilt on every install, local or from a git URL. Previously `git pull` without a manual `npm run build`, or `npm i -g github:…`, left the CLI running stale/absent compiled code — so pushed fixes never reached the machine.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Shared secrets-auth gate that offers to sign you in** — a single set of helpers (`probeSecretsAuth` → `ensureSecretsAuth`) reuses each provider's own `authCheck` and honours a resolved token identity, and now backs every entry point. When the provider isn't signed in on an interactive terminal, envbeam **prompts and runs the login command for you** (`doppler login` / `op signin`) instead of dead-ending:
  - `init` offers to log in the moment you pick Doppler/1Password (interactive terminals only), before writing config.
  - `push`/`pause` gate **before touching git** when two-way sync would push to the provider — offering login, and only erroring if you decline or it's non-interactive (previously git was committed and pushed, then the run died at the secrets step, leaving a half-applied checkpoint).
  - `resume`/`pull` gate the same way up front (they pull secrets, so they need auth).
  - Read-only commands (`status`, `doctor`) are unaffected; `doctor` reports auth state without blocking. Non-interactive runs (CI, pipes) never hang on a login prompt — they fail with a clear hint.
- **Automatic secrets-project provisioning** — the secrets provider gains an `ensureReady` step: on an interactive `init`/`push`/`resume`, envbeam verifies the backing Doppler project exists and, if not, offers to create it (`doppler projects create`). When it already exists, it says so and reuses it (the provider stays the source of truth). Non-interactive runs surface a clear "create it with …" hint rather than creating silently.
- **`envbeam init <name>` bootstraps an existing project** — if the named project is already registered, `init` reuses the `pull` bootstrap (clone → restore `.envbeam.yaml` from the registry snapshot → pull secrets → sync) instead of scaffolding a duplicate. A bare `envbeam init` in an already-initialized repo is now idempotent: it reports "already initialized" with next steps (exit 0) instead of erroring, and still re-scaffolds under `--force`.
- **Git remote + branch recorded in Doppler** — on `push`, envbeam writes `ENVBEAM_GIT_REMOTE` and `ENVBEAM_GIT_BRANCH` into the project's Doppler config (best-effort, both sync modes) so the provider alone tells you what repo and branch to pull. These `ENVBEAM_`-prefixed keys are filtered out of the materialized `.env` (like `DOPPLER_` vars) and never pushed back as app secrets.

### Changed
- **Self-heal Docker on resume/pull — install it *and* start it** — if the Docker CLI is missing, envbeam installs it for you (`brew install --cask docker` on macOS, etc.); if the daemon is down, it starts Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or the docker service (Linux) and waits for it to be ready. This runs **before preflight**, so a missing/stopped Docker no longer hard-blocks (previously preflight failed before the container step could fix it). Container `up()` keeps an idempotent check as a backstop. After the container starts, resume waits for the database to accept connections before migrations/restore.
- **Resume no longer false-warns "psql cannot connect to postgres"** — the database connectivity probe was running at preflight, before secrets were materialized and the container was up, so it always failed. Preflight now checks only that the DB client tools are present; actual connectivity is validated after the container is up and secrets are written.
- **Storage-gated commands self-heal instead of dead-ending** — `list`, `pull <project>`, and `delete` no longer stop at "Global storage not configured. Run `envbeam setup`". A shared `ensureStorageReady` helper installs the Doppler CLI if needed, offers to sign you in, then imports the `ENVBEAM_S3_*` settings from the Doppler `envbeam-global` project (its usual home) and continues with the requested command. It only falls back to guiding you to `envbeam setup` when no settings exist anywhere. `push`/`init` reuse the same helper (silently — no extra prompts) so a project auto-registers as soon as storage is available.
- **`ENVBEAM_DISABLE_STORAGE` escape hatch** — set it to keep envbeam fully offline (no Doppler/S3 registry access). Used to make the CLI integration tests hermetic so they no longer register junk projects in the real registry.
- **Auto-install missing DB client tools on `push`/`pull`** — when a snapshot needs `pg_dump`/`psql` (or `mysqldump`/`mysql`) and they're absent, envbeam now offers to install them for you (via the existing `ensureTools` flow; added Postgres/MySQL client entries to the tool registry) instead of telling you to install them by hand. It prints the resolved connection target too (e.g. `connecting to agentlab@localhost:5432/agentlab`). If the install is declined/fails, it skips the snapshot with an honest reason rather than the old misleading "database not reachable".
- **Smarter DB connection discovery from `.env`** — connection resolution now (a) recognizes SQLAlchemy/driver-qualified URL schemes like `postgresql+psycopg://` (normalized to `postgresql://` for the CLI), (b) discovers app-prefixed URL vars such as `AGENTLAB_DATABASE_URL` when no standard `DATABASE_URL` is set, and (c) merges `.env.local` / `.env.development` (filling gaps) in addition to the primary `.env`.
- **First push now backs up the database when nothing exists yet** — instead of only recording a change-detection baseline, `push` checks the sync target: if no snapshot has ever been uploaded for the workspace, it takes an **initial snapshot** so the data actually exists remotely. Subsequent pushes fall back to change-detection. When the DB can't be read (down, or client tools like `pg_dump`/`psql` missing), the step now says so plainly instead of falsely claiming "baseline recorded".
- **Change-detection works without configured tables** — the fingerprint now always includes the whole-database on-disk size and approximate row count (Postgres: `pg_database_size` + `pg_stat_user_tables`; MySQL: `information_schema.tables`), read via the `.env` connection. Pinning `changeTables` still adds exact per-table counts. Messages report the signal, e.g. `data changed → ~48.2 MB, ~12,043 row(s)`.
- **Clearer per-step messaging for `push`/`pull`** — each step now says what it did and why. In particular the database step explains the first-push case ("recorded a change-detection baseline (first push) — no snapshot yet; … run `envbeam push --snapshot` to force one now") instead of the terse "baseline recorded", and the summary line reports a concrete reason ("no snapshot — baseline recorded (first push)") rather than the misleading "no changes". Session outcomes read "synced" / "nothing to sync" instead of "noop", and pull reports where secrets were written.

### Fixed
- **`push` registry update recorded an empty git remote** — it read a non-existent `git.remoteUrl` detection field (should be `git.url`), so re-pushing a project reported a spurious "already exists with a different git remote" conflict. It now records the real remote.
- **Bootstrap landed on the wrong branch** — the registry stored the config's `branch` value, which defaults to the literal sentinel `current`, so `git checkout current` failed during `pull`/`init <name>` and you fell back to the default branch. A new `resolveBranch` helper records the actual detected branch (e.g. `wave-1-identity`); both `init` and `push` use it, so the bootstrap checks out the branch the project was pushed from.
- **Subdirectory-aware compose detection** — `envbeam init`/`doctor` now find Docker Compose files kept under `infra/`, `deploy/`, `docker/`, `.devcontainer/`, and similar subdirectories (a shallow, depth-2 scan), not just the repo root. Monorepos that don't keep a root-level compose file are now correctly detected as `container.mode: compose`, which also unblocks database provider/service detection. Root-level files still take priority; among sibling subdirectories, dev-oriented locations (`infra/`, `docker/`, …) win over `deploy/`/prod ones. Well-known vendor/build directories (`node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `dist/`, …) are skipped.
- **Alembic migration detection** — `detectMigrateCommand` now recognizes SQLAlchemy/Alembic projects via `alembic.ini` (root or nested), emitting `alembic upgrade head` (or `alembic -c <path> upgrade head` when nested).

### Tests
- Added coverage for subdirectory compose detection, root-over-subdir and dev-over-deploy preference, ignored-directory skipping, and Alembic (root + nested) migration detection.
- Added coverage for `checkSecretsAuth` (missing CLI, installed-but-unauthenticated, authenticated, 1Password, and the no-op `none` provider) and for `push` fail-fast: two-way sync aborts before git when the provider is unauthenticated, and proceeds when authenticated.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Storage provider picker** — `envbeam storage setup` now asks which S3-compatible provider you use (Cloudflare R2, Hetzner, Backblaze B2, AWS S3, or any other) and pre-fills the endpoint and region accordingly. AWS S3 no longer requires a custom endpoint.
- **Reuse existing Doppler storage settings** — if `ENVBEAM_S3_*` secrets already exist in the `envbeam-global` Doppler project, setup offers to reuse them instead of re-entering credentials.
- **Import storage during `envbeam init`** — when the Doppler secrets provider is selected and no global storage is configured yet, init offers to import existing storage settings from Doppler so projects auto-register without a separate setup step.

### Changed
- **`envbeam storage setup` no longer assumes AWS** — the AWS CLI (used purely as the S3 client for any provider) is now checked only after you choose to proceed, with Doppler verified first. The wizard makes clear envbeam works with any S3-compatible storage.

### Tests
- Added unit coverage for `readExistingDopplerStorage` (the Doppler reuse-detection logic shared by `storage setup` and `init`): full credentials, AWS-style missing endpoint/region defaults, missing required secrets, command failure, and unparseable output.
