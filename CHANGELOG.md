## [0.20.0] - 2026-07-10

Phase 2 of `planning/SYNC_SAFETY.md`: give the registry a total order that does not depend on any machine's clock, and stop concurrent pushes from silently deleting each other.

### Added
- **`revision` on every project entry** — a monotonic integer, incremented on each successful push. This is the ordering envbeam has been missing: `lastPush` is a local wall-clock string, so a laptop three minutes fast permanently won every race. `lastPush` and `machineId` are now documented as human-readable metadata, never read for ordering. Old registries parse: `revision` defaults to `0`.
- **`checkpoint` on every project entry** (`registry/types.ts`) — `{revision, gitCommit, gitBranch, snapshotName?, sessionName?, secretsHash?, machineId, at}`. Schema only; Phase 5 writes it.
- **`registerProject(entry, {expectedRevision})`** returns the stored entry with its new revision, and refuses with a `SafetyError` when the remote entry has moved past the caller's base — so an old machine can't overwrite a newer push's `configSnapshot` and checkpoint (**R2**).

### Fixed
- **Concurrent pushes of different projects no longer drop one of them (R1).** The registry is a single JSON object holding every project, and `registerProject` was a plain read-modify-write against S3: two machines pushing at once, and the second `save()` erased the first machine's entry. Writes are now conditional on the ETag read (`aws s3api put-object --if-match`), with a bounded retry that reloads and re-applies *only our own entry*, leaving the other machine's write intact. A registry that doesn't exist yet is created with `--if-none-match '*'`, so exactly one racing machine creates it.
- **`initializeIfNeeded` no longer has a check-then-write window** where two machines setting up at once could have one overwrite the other's freshly-populated registry with an empty one.
- Endpoints without conditional-write support (some MinIO/R2 versions) are detected from the CLI/endpoint error, fall back to an unconditional write, and then **read back and verify** — a lost update cannot be prevented there, but it is reported loudly with the names of the dropped projects rather than passing silently.

## [0.19.1] - 2026-07-10

Phase 1 of `planning/SYNC_SAFETY.md`: start recording a **base** — the remote state this machine last observed, whether by pulling it or by pushing it. No behavior depends on it yet; the guards in the next phase do. Shipping it first means machines have a base by the time those guards start reading one.

### Added
- **`WorkspaceState` gains `baseRevision`, `baseGitCommit`, `baseSnapshotName`, `baseSessionName`, `secretsBase`, and `dotenvHash`** (`core/state.ts`). `secretsBase` holds a set hash plus per-key value hashes — never a plaintext value — so a two-way push can later do a key-level three-way diff.
- **Write points:** `baseGitCommit` on every resume and on a successful push; `baseSnapshotName` on snapshot upload and on restore; `baseSessionName` on session push and pull; `secretsBase` + `dotenvHash` whenever secrets are materialized (both `dotenv` and `run-wrapper` output modes). Nothing is recorded under `--dry-run`.
- **`GitStatus.commit`** — the full sha of HEAD, absent on an unborn branch.
- **`gitIsAncestor()` / `gitHasCommit()`** in `providers/git/git.ts`. Commit ancestry is the only decidable lineage test envbeam has; anchoring the other domains' checkpoints to a commit sha is what will let `pull` verify that the code it restores data *into* contains the migrations that data expects.

## [0.19.0] - 2026-07-10

Phase 0 of `planning/SYNC_SAFETY.md`: the four paths where `pull` could destroy data that existed nowhere else. Each is a real, reachable bug, not a hypothetical, and each now has a regression test that fails against the previous code.

### Fixed
- **`pull` no longer restores a snapshot this machine pushed, over data changed since (D1).** `lastSnapshotTimestamp` was written on every push and then never read — only `lastRestoredTimestamp` gated the restore. So: push at T5, keep working, `pull` → `restore: auto` silently overwrote the newer local rows with your own T5 dump (and `restore: prompt` defaulted to yes). The new `snapshotBase()` in `core/state.ts` considers both timestamps, so a snapshot this machine produced can never look "newer" than this machine.
- **`pull` warns loudly instead of restoring when the newest remote snapshot is *older* than local state.** Previously this case was indistinguishable from "up to date" and printed a dim one-liner. It now names both timestamps and the machine that pushed the stale snapshot, and points at `--force`.
- **`pull` never auto-restores over a locally-changed database (D4).** `hasChanged()` existed but ran only on the push path. A restore is a whole-database overwrite; if local data moved since the recorded base, the two sides have genuinely diverged and no timestamp can adjudicate that. `restore: auto` is downgraded to a prompt that defaults to **no**, and the local database is dumped to `<state>/pre-restore/` before any forced overwrite. Divergence is never resolved non-interactively — `--yes` declines rather than discarding data, since `AutoPrompter.confirm` answers *yes* to every prompt regardless of its default.
- **Session pull no longer deliberately prefers a stale archive (T1).** `claudeNative.pull` chose `candidates.find(c => c.machine !== thisMachine)` — "prefer not-mine" — so a machine holding the newest archive would restore an older one from elsewhere over its own transcripts. It now takes the newest archive, whoever pushed it.
- **Session pull compares the archive against local activity before copying (T2).** `newestActivity()` existed and was only used to pick a config dir. An archive older than the local `.jsonl` transcripts is now refused with an explanation rather than copied over them. `safeCopySessionTree` also preserves mtimes from the archive, so a restored transcript keeps the time it was last *written* — without which this comparison is meaningless after the first pull.
- **`restore` re-baselines the change-detection fingerprint**, so the next `push` doesn't read the restore itself as a local data change.

### Added
- **`envbeam pull --force`** — the single, explicit escape hatch for all of the above. Every guard that honors it logs what it overrode. Threaded through `RunContext.force` → `ProviderContext.force`.
- `ResumeReport.database.restoreSkipped` records *why* an available snapshot was not restored; it appears in the run report.

## [0.18.3] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **README** — dropped the "run `envbeam storage setup` once" prompt from the quick start (`init` handles it, and the commands are already listed), and collapsed the Development section into a pointer to `DEVELOPMENT.md` rather than duplicating its command table.
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** — refreshed the status block: 241 tests across 27 files, the `postgres:14` version-skew integration failure is resolved, and the unfixed data-loss paths in `planning/SYNC_SAFETY.md` are now called out.

## [0.18.2] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **README** — dropped the decorative emoji (terminal glyphs in the sample output are untouched, since that's what envbeam actually prints); scoped the pitch to switching between computers rather than cloud VMs; and corrected the secrets note — they *are* beamed, they just never land in envbeam's storage, since both machines re-materialize them from Doppler/1Password.

## [0.18.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **Published to the public npm registry** — install with `npm install -g envbeam` instead of a `git+ssh` URL. README's install section and the stale-build reinstall hint printed by `cli.ts` both now point at npm, which is also the channel the 0.18.0 update check reads.
- Added `LICENSE` (MIT was declared in `package.json` but the file was missing) and `repository`/`homepage`/`bugs` metadata so the npm page links back to the source.

### Fixed
- **Regenerated `schema/envbeam.schema.json`**, which had drifted from `src/core/config/schema.ts` — it was missing the `claude-native` session provider and carried a stale `session.provider` default. The schema ships in the published tarball, so 0.18.0 shipped the stale copy.

## [0.18.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Update check + self-upgrade before every command** — envbeam now checks the npm registry for a newer release before a command runs (`src/core/util/updateCheck.ts`, wired as a commander `preAction` hook in `src/cli.ts`). When a newer version exists on an interactive **global npm** install, it asks and, on yes, runs `npm install -g envbeam@latest` **for you** and re-execs your original command against the new code — never dead-ending with "run X yourself". The check is bounded (2s registry timeout via `AbortController`; any failure silently continues on the current version) and throttled (result cached in `stateDir()/update-check.json`, at most one registry hit per 24h — and a *failed* read is cached for an hour, so an offline machine doesn't pay the timeout on every command). A declined version is snoozed so it won't nag again the same day.
  - **Safe by context:** never prompts or mutates in non-interactive/CI, under `--yes`, or under `--dry-run` — it prints a one-line stderr notice and continues (auto-upgrading mid-pipeline under `--yes` would be surprising). `-V`/`-h` skip the check entirely (no action fires). Disable with `--no-update-check` or `ENVBEAM_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.
  - **Install-method aware:** only a global npm install is auto-upgraded. A git/source checkout (self-heals via the build stamp instead), an `npx` cache, or a project-local `node_modules` dependency is detected and left untouched with an explanation.
  - `compareSemver` gives real semver precedence (`0.9.0 < 0.10.0`, `0.18.0-beta.1 < 0.18.0`) rather than string comparison.

## [0.17.0] - 2026-07-09

### Changed
- **`init <name>` no longer pulls implicitly** — when the name already exists in the registry, `init` used to silently delegate to the pull bootstrap, which clones and runs a full resume (fast-forwards git, overwrites `.env`, may start containers and apply migrations). It now reports the existing entry (remote, last push), states what a pull would do, and **asks**. Declining scaffolds a local `.envbeam.yaml`, which is what `init` implies. `--yes` still consents to the pull.
- **`init <name>` run inside the project's own checkout no longer nests a clone** — the pull bootstrap targets `./<name>`, so confirming a pull from inside `synthetic-signals/` used to clone a second copy at `synthetic-signals/synthetic-signals`. When the current directory is already a checkout of the project's remote, it is used as the target.

### Added
- **Divergence check before pulling into an existing checkout** — `pull <name>` now fetches and reports the local branch's state against its upstream (commits ahead/behind, the ahead commits themselves, uncommitted files) before running resume. If the checkout holds work the remote hasn't seen, or the branch has no upstream, it requires confirmation and exits non-zero when declined. Clean, in-sync checkouts proceed unprompted.
- `inspectLocalGit` / `hasUnsyncedWork` / `sameRemote` helpers in `core/util/gitSync.ts`.

### Fixed
- **`pull <name>` into a config-less checkout of the right repo no longer dead-ends** — instead of erroring with "Remove the directory", it restores `.envbeam.yaml` from the registry snapshot when the directory is a checkout of the project's own remote.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-07-08

### Security
- **Doppler-anchored integrity hashes for backups** — on `push`, envbeam records the `sha256` of every uploaded artifact (encrypted DB snapshot, encrypted session archive, and the session metadata) in a per-workspace manifest secret in the **Doppler `envbeam-global` project** — a different trust domain than the storage bucket. On `pull`/`resume` it verifies the downloaded artifact against that hash **before** decrypting/restoring and **refuses** on mismatch. So tampering with or rolling back a bucket object is now detectable unless the attacker also has Doppler write access (and age already makes tampering-without-the-key fail on decrypt). The plaintext session metadata is now hash-verified too, so a bad `workspaceRoot` can't drive path translation. The manifest is pruned to what's still on the sync target, and a missing hash (artifact pushed before this version, or Doppler unavailable) warns rather than blocking.

## [0.15.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Detect all database URLs by scheme + warn on ambiguity** — `findDatabaseUrls` finds every Postgres/MySQL connection URL in the environment by its scheme (not by a hard-coded var name). When more than one URL of the same engine is present, `push`/`pull` now warn (naming the one envbeam picked) so you can pin `database.connection` and not silently snapshot/restore the wrong database.

## [0.14.1] - 2026-07-08

### Security
- **Command injection via detected Alembic path** — a scanned `alembic.ini` path was interpolated into a `sh -c` migrate command, so a repo with a maliciously-named nested directory could execute arbitrary code on `resume`/`pull`. The path is now shell-quoted (`shellArgQuote`).
- **No silent `curl | sh` tool installs in CI/non-interactive runs** — auto-install now requires a real prompt on a TTY, or an explicit `--yes` non-interactively; it never installs (piping vendor scripts to `sh`) by default in piped/CI contexts.
- **Secrets no longer leak to the command trace** — `--verbose`/`ENVBEAM_TRACE` output now redacts URL credentials (`postgres://user:***@…`, token git remotes). The recorded `ENVBEAM_GIT_REMOTE` also strips any embedded token before it reaches `doppler secrets set` argv.
- **Bootstrap validates the registry-supplied git remote/branch** — refuses code-executing transports (`ext::`, `file:`) and flag-looking values before `git clone`/`checkout`.
- **Untrusted session archives handled safely on restore** — extraction uses `--no-same-owner`, refuses any archive containing a symlink (tar breakout), copies plain files only, and never overwrites security-sensitive Claude config (`settings*.json`, `*.mcp.json`) that could inject hooks.
- **No plaintext left on disk** — DB snapshots and session archives are written to private `mkdtemp` (0700) dirs and removed in `finally` on every path; the age private key is written with `O_EXCL` inside a fresh 0700 dir instead of a predictable tmp name.

### Fixed
- Change-detection fingerprint no longer folds in volatile planner estimates (`pg_database_size`, `n_live_tup`, MySQL `table_rows`) when change tables are configured, so `push` stops reporting spurious "data changed".
- `envbeam -V`/`--help` no longer trigger a full self-rebuild; the rebuild re-exec now maps a signal-killed child to a non-zero exit instead of 0.
- Shallow detection scan no longer skips `.github`/`.gitlab` (the `.startsWith('.git')` over-match); `.git` is still ignored.
- Doppler `ensureReady` no longer hard-blocks a scoped service token that lacks `projects list` permission.
- `parsePortConflict` now also matches Docker Desktop's "address already in use" wording.

## [0.14.0] - 2026-07-08

### Changed
- **Database snapshots are now encrypted at rest by default** — previously `sync.encrypt` defaulted to `none`, so a full DB dump (potentially your entire dataset) uploaded in plaintext, while sessions were always encrypted. Now, when age keys are available (they're set up as part of session sync / `envbeam storage setup`), snapshots are age-encrypted by default — no config needed. An explicit `sync.encrypt` still wins; if no keys exist, envbeam warns that the snapshot is stored unencrypted rather than failing. Restore now detects encryption from the **file extension** (`.age`/`.gpg`), so it decrypts correctly regardless of local config, auto-installing `age` and fetching keys from Doppler as needed.

### Added
- **Post-restore session hint** — after `pull`/`resume` restores Claude sessions, envbeam tells you how to use them: *"Your Claude sessions are restored — run `claude --resume` in this project to pick one up."*

## [0.13.3] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **`pull` couldn't find pushed sessions ("no session backups found")** — the sync target's `list()` parses every object as a database-snapshot filename (`<workspace>__<ts>__<machine>`) and filtered out session archives (`claude-session-…`), so they were invisible even though the push succeeded. Added a raw name-prefix `listNames()` to the sync target (S3 + local-folder/syncthing); session pull now uses it, so pushed sessions are found and restored.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Session encryption auto-installs `age`** — pushing a session on a machine without `age` crashed the whole push with `spawn age ENOENT`. The session provider now installs `age` for you before encrypting/decrypting (it was already in the tool registry — just never requested), and the Session step in both `push` and `pull` is best-effort: a session-sync failure warns and continues instead of aborting the checkpoint after git has already pushed.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Session push failed with `tar: Invalid replacement flag`** — Claude project dir names start with a dash (`-Users-…`), which tar parsed as bundled options (`-U -s …`). The tar invocation now passes `--` before the directory name (verified against real bsdtar).

## [0.13.0] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Claude session sync never found any sessions** — three bugs made the Session step a permanent no-op:
  1. the project-dir name stripped Claude Code's **leading dash** (`projects/Users-…` instead of `projects/-Users-…`), so the session folder was never found even in `~/.claude`;
  2. only `~/.claude` was searched — users running Claude with an aliased `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (e.g. `~/.claude-personal`) were invisible;
  3. the archive-name parser assumed dash-free workspace/machine names, so restore failed for names like `synthetic-signals`.

### Added
- **Claude config-dir discovery** — honors `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`/`CLAUDE_HOME`, otherwise scans every `~/.claude*` dir and picks the one with the most recent session activity for the project (logged: `using Claude config ~/.claude-personal`). Restore resolves the destination on the **target** machine the same way, extracts to a temp dir, merges into the locally-correct project dir (source and target sanitized names differ when paths differ), and translates absolute paths inside the session files. Push logs the archive size; pull prefers the newest archive from a *different* machine and logs where it restored to.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Language dependency sync on `pull`/`resume`** — a new Dependencies step detects the project's toolchains from lockfiles (root + two levels deep, vendor dirs skipped), **installs the package manager itself if missing** (uv, poetry, pipenv, pnpm, yarn, bun, npm, bundler, composer, go, cargo — per the auto-install rule), then syncs dependencies against the just-pulled lockfiles: `uv sync`, `poetry install`, `pnpm install`, `npm ci` (or `npm install` when `node_modules` exists), `go mod download`, `cargo fetch`, `bundle install`, `composer install`. Monorepos work naturally (workspace lockfiles live at the root; per-app lockfiles like `apps/web/package-lock.json` get their own install). Best-effort: failures warn and are listed in the report (`deps: 2 synced`), never block the resume. So after `envbeam pull`, things like `make api` (`uv run uvicorn …`) work immediately.

## [0.11.7] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Port-conflict self-heal on `compose up`** — when a published port is already allocated (e.g. another Postgres on 5432), envbeam now finds the culprit: if it's another container it names it (with its compose project) and offers to **stop it and retry**; if it's a host process it identifies it via `lsof` (e.g. a brew postgres) so you know exactly what to stop. Failure hints are now tailored to the actual error (port conflict / daemon down / image pull) instead of a generic "ensure Docker is running".
- Verbose trace failure summaries now surface the real error line (e.g. `Error response from daemon: …`) instead of progress noise like `db Pulling`.

## [0.11.6] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Shadowed/stale installs are now self-evident and self-repairing** — verified empirically that a fresh git install of 0.11.5 always prints the `(build …)` stamp, so a bare version in `-V` proves the shell is resolving a *different, stale* install (e.g. an old `npm link`ed checkout shadowing the global bin). Now: (a) a compiled `dist/` with **no** build stamp counts as stale and triggers the in-place rebuild + re-exec; (b) `--verbose` leads with `envbeam <version+build> · <cli path>`; (c) **every non-zero exit** prints the same identity footer — so the running install is visible in any error output. Diagnose duplicates with `which -a envbeam`.

## [0.11.5] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Stale builds can no longer masquerade as new versions** — root cause of "the fix didn't work": `-V` read `package.json` at runtime, so a `git pull` without a rebuild reported the new version while executing old compiled code (which predated the Docker auto-start entirely). The build now stamps `dist/build-info.json` (version + git sha + timestamp); `-V` prints it (`0.11.5 (build abc1234, …)`), and on a version mismatch the CLI **rebuilds itself and re-runs your command** (source checkouts) or prints the exact reinstall command. Escape hatch: `ENVBEAM_SKIP_REBUILD=1`.
- Empirically verified the Docker 25.0.3 daemon quirk against the real 25.0.3 CLI: dead daemon → exit 0, empty stdout, error on stderr — the digit-check from 0.11.4 handles it correctly.

## [0.11.4] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Docker now actually starts itself (macOS + Windows), no user action** — the daemon check now treats any non-version `docker info` output as "down" (docker 25.x prints the connect error to stdout and exits 0, which fooled the previous check), so envbeam reliably detects a stopped daemon and launches it. macOS tries Docker Desktop → OrbStack → colima; Windows tries the system-wide and per-user Docker Desktop paths; Linux starts the docker service. A reactive backstop also retries `compose up` after force-starting Docker if the daemon error still surfaces. No prompt, no waiting on the user.

### Added
- **`ENVBEAM_TRACE=1` also enables command tracing** — same output as `--verbose` but from process start and independent of flag position, so you can verify a deployed build (`ENVBEAM_TRACE=1 envbeam list`) and debug non-interactively.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **`--verbose` now traces every external command** — with `-v`/`--verbose`, envbeam prints each shell-out (`$ docker info …`, `$ doppler secrets …`, `$ aws s3 cp …`) and its exit code to stderr, so you can see exactly what it's doing and where a step fails. (Global flag: put it before the subcommand, e.g. `envbeam --verbose pull`.)

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Docker daemon detection was a false positive on Docker CLI 25.x** — `docker info --format '{{.ServerVersion}}'` exits **0** with empty output (error on stderr) when the daemon is down on older CLIs, so envbeam thought Docker was up, skipped starting it, and then failed at `compose up`. The check now requires a real server version, not just exit 0 — so `ensureDockerRunning` actually starts Docker, and preflight reports the daemon honestly. Shared `isDockerDaemonUp` is reused by the compose/devcontainer auth-checks.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- **Updates now actually take effect** — added a `prepare` script so `dist/` (which is gitignored and drives the `envbeam` bin) is rebuilt on every install, local or from a git URL. Previously `git pull` without a manual `npm run build`, or `npm i -g github:…`, left the CLI running stale/absent compiled code — so pushed fixes never reached the machine.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added
- **Shared secrets-auth gate that offers to sign you in** — a single set of helpers (`probeSecretsAuth` → `ensureSecretsAuth`) reuses each provider's own `authCheck` and honours a resolved token identity, and now backs every entry point. When the provider isn't signed in on an interactive terminal, envbeam **prompts and runs the login command for you** (`doppler login` / `op signin`) instead of dead-ending:
  - `init` offers to log in the moment you pick Doppler/1Password (interactive terminals only), before writing config.
  - `push`/`pause` gate **before touching git** when two-way sync would push to the provider — offering login, and only erroring if you decline or it's non-interactive (previously git was committed and pushed, then the run died at the secrets step, leaving a half-applied checkpoint).
  - `resume`/`pull` gate the same way up front (they pull secrets, so they need auth).
  - Read-only commands (`status`, `doctor`) are unaffected; `doctor` reports auth state without blocking. Non-interactive runs (CI, pipes) never hang on a login prompt — they fail with a clear hint.
- **Automatic secrets-project provisioning** — the secrets provider gains an `ensureReady` step: on an interactive `init`/`push`/`resume`, envbeam verifies the backing Doppler project exists and, if not, offers to create it (`doppler projects create`). When it already exists, it says so and reuses it (the provider stays the source of truth). Non-interactive runs surface a clear "create it with …" hint rather than creating silently.
- **`envbeam init <name>` bootstraps an existing project** — if the named project is already registered, `init` reuses the `pull` bootstrap (clone → restore `.envbeam.yaml` from the registry snapshot → pull secrets → sync) instead of scaffolding a duplicate. A bare `envbeam init` in an already-initialized repo is now idempotent: it reports "already initialized" with next steps (exit 0) instead of erroring, and still re-scaffolds under `--force`.
- **Git remote + branch recorded in Doppler** — on `push`, envbeam writes `ENVBEAM_GIT_REMOTE` and `ENVBEAM_GIT_BRANCH` into the project's Doppler config (best-effort, both sync modes) so the provider alone tells you what repo and branch to pull. These `ENVBEAM_`-prefixed keys are filtered out of the materialized `.env` (like `DOPPLER_` vars) and never pushed back as app secrets.

### Changed
- **Self-heal Docker on resume/pull — install it *and* start it** — if the Docker CLI is missing, envbeam installs it for you (`brew install --cask docker` on macOS, etc.); if the daemon is down, it starts Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows) or the docker service (Linux) and waits for it to be ready. This runs **before preflight**, so a missing/stopped Docker no longer hard-blocks (previously preflight failed before the container step could fix it). Container `up()` keeps an idempotent check as a backstop. After the container starts, resume waits for the database to accept connections before migrations/restore.
- **Resume no longer false-warns "psql cannot connect to postgres"** — the database connectivity probe was running at preflight, before secrets were materialized and the container was up, so it always failed. Preflight now checks only that the DB client tools are present; actual connectivity is validated after the container is up and secrets are written.
- **Storage-gated commands self-heal instead of dead-ending** — `list`, `pull <project>`, and `delete` no longer stop at "Global storage not configured. Run `envbeam setup`". A shared `ensureStorageReady` helper installs the Doppler CLI if needed, offers to sign you in, then imports the `ENVBEAM_S3_*` settings from the Doppler `envbeam-global` project (its usual home) and continues with the requested command. It only falls back to guiding you to `envbeam setup` when no settings exist anywhere. `push`/`init` reuse the same helper (silently — no extra prompts) so a project auto-registers as soon as storage is available.
- **`ENVBEAM_DISABLE_STORAGE` escape hatch** — set it to keep envbeam fully offline (no Doppler/S3 registry access). Used to make the CLI integration tests hermetic so they no longer register junk projects in the real registry.
- **Auto-install missing DB client tools on `push`/`pull`** — when a snapshot needs `pg_dump`/`psql` (or `mysqldump`/`mysql`) and they're absent, envbeam now offers to install them for you (via the existing `ensureTools` flow; added Postgres/MySQL client entries to the tool registry) instead of telling you to install them by hand. It prints the resolved connection target too (e.g. `connecting to agentlab@localhost:5432/agentlab`). If the install is declined/fails, it skips the snapshot with an honest reason rather than the old misleading "database not reachable".
- **Smarter DB connection discovery from `.env`** — connection resolution now (a) recognizes SQLAlchemy/driver-qualified URL schemes like `postgresql+psycopg://` (normalized to `postgresql://` for the CLI), (b) discovers app-prefixed URL vars such as `AGENTLAB_DATABASE_URL` when no standard `DATABASE_URL` is set, and (c) merges `.env.local` / `.env.development` (filling gaps) in addition to the primary `.env`.
- **First push now backs up the database when nothing exists yet** — instead of only recording a change-detection baseline, `push` checks the sync target: if no snapshot has ever been uploaded for the workspace, it takes an **initial snapshot** so the data actually exists remotely. Subsequent pushes fall back to change-detection. When the DB can't be read (down, or client tools like `pg_dump`/`psql` missing), the step now says so plainly instead of falsely claiming "baseline recorded".
- **Change-detection works without configured tables** — the fingerprint now always includes the whole-database on-disk size and approximate row count (Postgres: `pg_database_size` + `pg_stat_user_tables`; MySQL: `information_schema.tables`), read via the `.env` connection. Pinning `changeTables` still adds exact per-table counts. Messages report the signal, e.g. `data changed → ~48.2 MB, ~12,043 row(s)`.
- **Clearer per-step messaging for `push`/`pull`** — each step now says what it did and why. In particular the database step explains the first-push case ("recorded a change-detection baseline (first push) — no snapshot yet; … run `envbeam push --snapshot` to force one now") instead of the terse "baseline recorded", and the summary line reports a concrete reason ("no snapshot — baseline recorded (first push)") rather than the misleading "no changes". Session outcomes read "synced" / "nothing to sync" instead of "noop", and pull reports where secrets were written.

### Fixed
- **`push` registry update recorded an empty git remote** — it read a non-existent `git.remoteUrl` detection field (should be `git.url`), so re-pushing a project reported a spurious "already exists with a different git remote" conflict. It now records the real remote.
- **Bootstrap landed on the wrong branch** — the registry stored the config's `branch` value, which defaults to the literal sentinel `current`, so `git checkout current` failed during `pull`/`init <name>` and you fell back to the default branch. A new `resolveBranch` helper records the actual detected branch (e.g. `wave-1-identity`); both `init` and `push` use it, so the bootstrap checks out the branch the project was pushed from.
- **Subdirectory-aware compose detection** — `envbeam init`/`doctor` now find Docker Compose files kept under `infra/`, `deploy/`, `docker/`, `.devcontainer/`, and similar subdirectories (a shallow, depth-2 scan), not just the repo root. Monorepos that don't keep a root-level compose file are now correctly detected as `container.mode: compose`, which also unblocks database provider/service detection. Root-level files still take priority; among sibling subdirectories, dev-oriented locations (`infra/`, `docker/`, …) win over `deploy/`/prod ones. Well-known vendor/build directories (`node_modules/`, `.venv/`, `dist/`, …) are skipped.
- **Alembic migration detection** — `detectMigrateCommand` now recognizes SQLAlchemy/Alembic projects via `alembic.ini` (root or nested), emitting `alembic upgrade head` (or `alembic -c <path> upgrade head` when nested).

### Tests
- Added coverage for subdirectory compose detection, root-over-subdir and dev-over-deploy preference, ignored-directory skipping, and Alembic (root + nested) migration detection.
- Added coverage for `checkSecretsAuth` (missing CLI, installed-but-unauthenticated, authenticated, 1Password, and the no-op `none` provider) and for `push` fail-fast: two-way sync aborts before git when the provider is unauthenticated, and proceeds when authenticated.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Storage provider picker** — `envbeam storage setup` now asks which S3-compatible provider you use (Cloudflare R2, Hetzner, Backblaze B2, AWS S3, or any other) and pre-fills the endpoint and region accordingly. AWS S3 no longer requires a custom endpoint.
- **Reuse existing Doppler storage settings** — if `ENVBEAM_S3_*` secrets already exist in the `envbeam-global` Doppler project, setup offers to reuse them instead of re-entering credentials.
- **Import storage during `envbeam init`** — when the Doppler secrets provider is selected and no global storage is configured yet, init offers to import existing storage settings from Doppler so projects auto-register without a separate setup step.

### Changed
- **`envbeam storage setup` no longer assumes AWS** — the AWS CLI (used purely as the S3 client for any provider) is now checked only after you choose to proceed, with Doppler verified first. The wizard makes clear envbeam works with any S3-compatible storage.

### Tests
- Added unit coverage for `readExistingDopplerStorage` (the Doppler reuse-detection logic shared by `storage setup` and `init`): full credentials, AWS-style missing endpoint/region defaults, missing required secrets, command failure, and unparseable output.
